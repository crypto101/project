Crypto 101
==========

Crypto 101 is an introductory course on cryptography by lvh_. This is
a repository for the project as a whole: stuff that doesn't go
anywhere else, like roadmaps, marketing material, logos, et cetera.

If you are interested in the course or the book itself, you probably
want the website_. This Github organization houses the `website
development`_, `book development`_ as well as a number of related
software projects:

* stanczyk_, the recommended client
* merlyn_, the generic server software
* the Crypto 101 exercises_ for merlyn
